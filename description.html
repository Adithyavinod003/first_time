    <p>HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, is the code that defines the structure and content of a web page. It's the most fundamental building block of the web.</p>
    <ul>
        <li> <mark>Markup</mark>
            HTML is a text-based markup language that uses markup symbols or codes to tell web browsers how to display a page's content. <br>These codes are inserted into a file and are made up of individual pieces called elements or tags.</li>
            <li><mark> Structure</mark>    
                HTML defines the structure of a web page by using tags to denote structural semantics for text, such as paragraphs, lists, headings, links, and quotes. </li>
                <li><mark>Rendering</mark>
                    HTML is often assisted by other technologies, such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages like JavaScript. </li>
    </ul>

    <p>Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It defines the content and structure of web content. It is often assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.
     Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for its appearance</p>
